# Conceptual Identity Service

The main idea is to combine Scala Play with Scala Cats effects

*In this repository we found a component in charge of managing the representation 
of the user and its authentication.*

## What can the Identity Service do?

- Authenticate and create user representation with phone number and external generated JWT.
- Store user information if the user specifies it.
- Update user information if the user specifies it.
